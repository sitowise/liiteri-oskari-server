A Hammered Proof-of-Concept Jackson extension to support mixing GeoTools GML parsing into Jackson-dataformat-XML mappings. This is an attempt to support Complex Schema parsing
with simple data first workflows. Implementation Will Change.

To-DO
* Support GML deserializing with annotations ? @JacksonGMLProperty(...)
* Support Geometry serializing to at least WKT and GeoJSON with @JacksonGMLPropery annotation
