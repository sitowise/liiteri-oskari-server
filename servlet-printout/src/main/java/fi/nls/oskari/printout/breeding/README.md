fi.nls.oskari.printout.breeding

This subset is a drop-in from another project which was a sort of geowebcache tile populator.

These classes are used to gather map tiles required to build a larger than tile printout.
Code is based on and uses geowebcache-core.
 
Adapter classes in package fi.nls.oskari.printout.breeding.maplink are used
to glue tile grid calcs to map printout tile processing.
